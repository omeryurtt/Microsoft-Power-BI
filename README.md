## London-Bike-Sharing ðŸš²

Alongside PowerBI, I explored and analyzed the raw data using Python, utilizing libraries such as Pandas and Seaborn. You can review my Jupyter Notebook, where you will find a summary of the data visualizations that provide answers to questions.

### Questions:

1. **How many bikes shared annually, monthly and daily?**

2. **How many bike shared by Seasons?**

3. **What is seasonal demand per hours for bikes?**
   
4. **What is hourly bike share by day?**
   
5. **Comparison of demand for bicycles on holidays and weekends?**

6. **Biking Demand by Day of the Week (Percentage) & Seasonal Demand per Day for Bikes (Counts)**

7. **What is the correlation between weather condition and bike sharing?**
